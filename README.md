# currate
currate is a flexible and easy-to-use Python tool designed to discover web endpoints that do not implement rate limiting. It sends a controlled number of requests per second to specified URLs combined with endpoints from a wordlist, helping you identify potentially vulnerable targets that allow high request rates without blocking or throttling.
